wpplug findbroken (disables plugins one by one until 500 goes away)

wpplug reset (sets back to what it was when we started - aka save active_plugin as a var)

wpfix should try renaming .htaccess and see if that fixes it, and resetting it

what is the difference between wpfix and wptest?
- wpfix works on issues that can actually be solved by script
- wptest tells user where the issue likely is
- have wpfix run wptest if it can't fix the issue

test file that can check for regressions

# disable plugins
UPDATE wp_options SET option_value = 'a:0:{}' WHERE option_name = 'active_plugins';

... but I want to be able to pull them out one by one to test. renaming folders can cause plugins to erase their settings.
