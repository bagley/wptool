*** Bugs ***

the changelog is not showing. It is only showing wpuser/wpurl updates.


***Random todo list***

wpplug findbroken (disables plugins one by one until 500 goes away)

wpplug reset (sets back to what it was when we started - aka save active_plugin as a var)
- this will be useful when we start disabling plugins via the database

wpfix should try renaming .htaccess and see if that fixes it, and resetting it

what is the difference between wpfix and wptest?
- wpfix works on issues that can actually be solved by script
- wptest tells user where the issue likely is
- have wpfix run wptest if it can't fix the issue

test file that can check for regressions

# disable plugins
UPDATE wp_options SET option_value = 'a:0:{}' WHERE option_name = 'active_plugins';

... but I want to be able to pull them out one by one to test. renaming folders can cause plugins to erase their settings.

wpcore needs to check the download file that it acually succeeded. Right now it doesn't which can lead to a failed reinstall.

wpuser needs to be able to search database for a string. useful on installs with lots of users, and trying to find one user

standardize options

wpuser admin -l : will give a access link for the first admin user

have it check for deleteme user on load, or the first time wpuser is run?

access link should only be available for an hour

Have an option that will set higher security checks

wpmal: do common malware searches. remember the disclaimer of "this is just to help"

make a single devel branch for all the new things

wpscan: look for broken links or links that point outside of the root/home dir.
- try to use find2perl first

have the access link check for old copies of make-pass-[0-9a-zA-Z]*-\.php or
make-pass[^\.]*\.php
and remove them
