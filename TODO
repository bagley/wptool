!!BUG: wpuser 1 -l: needs to use siteurl if the wp is in a subdir
         and if siteurl and homeurl are different
       - it's missing the subdir part of the path


wpplug findbroken (disables plugins one by one until 500 goes away)

wpplug reset (sets back to what it was when we started - aka save active_plugin as a var)
- this will be useful when we start disabling plugins via the database

wpfix should try renaming .htaccess and see if that fixes it, and resetting it

what is the difference between wpfix and wptest?
- wpfix works on issues that can actually be solved by script
- wptest tells user where the issue likely is
- have wpfix run wptest if it can't fix the issue

test file that can check for regressions

# disable plugins
UPDATE wp_options SET option_value = 'a:0:{}' WHERE option_name = 'active_plugins';

... but I want to be able to pull them out one by one to test. 
renaming folders can cause plugins to erase their settings.

wpcore needs to check the download file that it acually succeeded. 
Right now it doesn't which can lead to a failed reinstall.

wpuser needs to be able to search database for a string. useful on 
installs with lots of users, and trying to find one user

standardize options

wpuser admin -l : will give a access link for the first admin user
or just wplogin/wpaccess

have it check for deleteme user on load, or the first time wpuser is run?

access link should only be available for an hour
- but are there situations where that won't work?

Have an option that will set higher security checks

wpscan: look for broken links or links that point outside of the root/home dir.
- try to use find2perl first

wpscan: look for symlinks that point outside of the main dir

add a 'noprompt' option to any command that requires one, so we can just 
run it without a prompt. nice for non-interactive scripts.

wpfix quiet: for when we need to call it from other functions w/o the info messages

wpdig - check that dns is pointing here
- also make a test file to verify?

wpcheck (or wptests or wpcore verify)
- checksum all wp files and that they really exist.
- (optional) check plugin and theme files (if in wp repo)

wptests - show extra vars in wp-config that may be causing issues
- make a test file to verify site is hosted here

wpurl (search and replace) needs to do a db backup before running
- any tool that modifies the db should do this
- prompts?

wpurl search url - search and display matches in the db of the url
- useful when figuring out what the previous url was
- alias: wpdb search/-s "string"
- can search for posts, or a full db search

wpfix quick/full: do a clear cache (quick) or a full: deactivate plugins,
  themes, check settings, verify hosting, verify php settings

wpscan: if fgrep is not found, use grep or other programs.

Add changelog

Fallbacks for wget
1) wget (full ssl checks)
2) curl
3) wget (no ssl cert check - older wget fails on w.org cert)

Testing script to check for regressions
- check for the word 'exit' (in case I put that instead of 'return')

wpplug/wptheme
- install and activate plugins/themes from the commandline
- update them too 
  -via loading wp core and having it do it
  -and also have an option to force it to do so
- have a reinstall option, to fix corrupt files.
- it needs to be able to install specific versions of them too

wpurl needs to have an option to set only siteurl or homeurl
- some sites are setup with a subdir with content but not wanting 
  to show a subdir path in the address bar

wpurl could have an "autodiscover" option, but that may be too awesome.

wpscan: when we grab the scanstrings, we need the option to use 
the devel or alpha branches. And the current url needs to be
changed to use the master, as strings is in the master branch now.

verify that it can handle, move, and work with domains with ports:
http://192.168.x.x:8888/wordpress http://www.domain.com

<?php $__FILE__=__FILE__;$__X__

add ability to install and activate plugins from command line.

shortlink https://short.link/wptool?

link others to wptool. have it fetch from github.

wptests, not wptest

wpcore reinstalls should do a find2perl that looks for unwritable files/folders.
- only on wp-admin and wp-includes
  - we move out the wp-* files
  - but in that case check the root dir
- add a 'force' option to do it anyways

wptool: look for a blank index.html (or the presence of any index.html) on wpfix/wptests/wptrace/wpurl... any function that is used for fixing. Just print out a warning.

wpfix should show .htaccess (as in via a cat to show the full contents).

also show the site url on other tools like wpuser and wptool?

use wpcli to update plugins

wpscan - look for pics that have php code in them, like social.png
- on the full, do a "checking for php code in pictures

wpkey - reset wp keys

wptool should look in index.php for folder if there is nothing in the current dir.

 ----------------------

have the access link check for old copies of make-pass-[0-9a-zA-Z]*-\.php or
make-pass[^\.]*\.php
and remove them
>> we also renamed the link to access-link and prompt the user to remove them
>> and we check that it actually is our file

wpmal: do common malware searches. remember the disclaimer of "this is just to help"
>> became wpscan. Scanner fully implemented.

make a single devel branch for all the new things
>> made devel and alpha branches
