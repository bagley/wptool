ChangeLog:

1.8.1

* 'wplogin' is an alias to wpuser # -l that will automatically
    give you a link to login as first admin user it finds. 
    No more searching for user ids, just run and click.
* 'wpplug --disable-all' will disable all plugins
    so you can quickly see if it is a plugin issue
* 'wpdb -s' shows the size of each table, and
    'wpdb' nows show database size and number of tables
* 'wpfix' now clears WP Super Cache files and
* 'wptool changes/man' show the changelog and readme 
    from within the terminal.
* 'wpfix' can now fix file permissions. Basic setup as of now.
- Fixed wpuser's access link to work with sites whos
    files are in a sub directory but the site is using 
    the regurlar path, for example:
    home: http://domain.com, but siteurl: http://domain.com/files
- Improvements on database and status messages.
- Some redoing and rethinking of the changes page.


1.8.0

* 'wpscan' is a new tool that does basic malware scanning
* 'wpcore new' can install wp
    After install, go to the site in the browser
    to configure database and set main user
- Improved wpuser access links
 - Fixes in php file
 - Removes even on Ctrl+C
 - Handles subdir installs
- Better documentation and Readme file
- Verify zip files are downloaded properly
- made wget work on older systems
  that don't have w.org's root cert


1.7.5.1

* 'wpbackup' and 'wprestore' and quick functions allow one to
    backup/restore the database and wp-content files.
* 'wpfix' now clears W3 Total Cache's files too.
- make __wp_rand_string function more robust and workable.
    It's now used in more places for better security.
- wpurl now asks user for confirmation on search and replace
- wpuser shows "only showing first 23 users" so we remember that.
- Some reformatting and better suggestions.


1.7.5

* 'wpurl OLD NEW' is a new option allows you to search and replace
    urls in the posts table. This is usually for fixing up 
    pic urls on site moves.
* 'wptrace' is a new tool that shows a trace of what WP is doing.
    This can help with wsod or odd errors.
* We now show recent big changes (during the last 3 weeks) on load.
- Added License file.
- Fixes to the access link (wpuser # -l) to work on sub directories,
    not show two '//' (for real this time), and only warn if 
    user not found (but go ahead and make the link anyways).
- dbconn was saying 'invalid query' when it really meant "bad argument'


1.7.4

* 'wpuser' now has options to list all users, and admins.
- check if access link exists before removing


1.7.3

* 'wperr' is a new tool that shows a tail of WP's error logs.


1.7.1.4

* 'wpuser # -l' is a new option that adds the ability to login 
    as any user using a given link. It does this by creating a link
    that asks WP for the cookies of the given user, and then loads
    them into the browser. Yet all the user is doing is specifying
    the user id, and then clicking the link. It automatically logs
    into the WP Dashboard. No more 'deleteme'!


1.7.1.3

* 'wpuser -n' now creates a random password for deleteme creation.
    No more having to redo the password, (or forgetting about it).
- Created readme file.
